          Scandinavian Design is a modern Nordic interior design trend that many
          people choose for its minimalistic and elegant beauty. This design
          style is widely applied not only in bedrooms or living rooms but also
          in kitchens.

          When talking about Scandinavian Design, simplicity and rustic beauty
          immediately come to mind. The dominant colors in this style are white
          and other neutral tones such as black, blue, cream, gray, etc. These
          neutral colors not only create a soft, comfortable feeling but also
          bring a modern and youthful breath to the space.

          A highlight of Scandinavian Design is minimalism. This minimalism is
          reflected in the neat arrangement of furniture and the choice of
          multifunctional pieces that save space. Looking at rooms designed in
          the Nordic style, we can see the sophistication in choosing and
          arranging furniture, creating an airy, spacious, and well-lit
          environment.

              White is the characteristic color of Scandinavian Design. It
              brings a simple, light, yet elegant beauty. White is also easy to
              combine with other neutral colors like black, gray, brown, and
              blue, creating a unique contrast. Additionally, with white as the
              dominant color, this design helps to open up the space, making it
              more airy, spacious, and modern...
